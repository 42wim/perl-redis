*** NOTICE ***

This is a modified version of the Redis module from CPAN.  It's what's
currently in use at Craigslist for our Redis work.

My goal is to share our work in the hopes of having it included back
into the main distribution.

See MyChanges.txt for details on how this differs from that module.
